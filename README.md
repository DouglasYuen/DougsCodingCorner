## Shopping Budgets

This test takes an array of items and a budget to determine how many different ways there are of buying things if one is to stay within a certain budget. Because of the function used to create the array of possible combiations, the runtime of this code is O(n^2). The budgets and prices are only passed in as integers in this test case, although the function generating the array combinations accepts generics.
